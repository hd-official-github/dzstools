This was a project created by me for a client who asked for a tool which can store bookmarks for all the handy saas products out in the market.
They also asked for a content tool which can scrape meta title and meta descriptions from websites and show them in a good format. 
They also needed a tool which can bulk audit websites and check their http status code and show the report.

# All tools
